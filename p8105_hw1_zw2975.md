P8105 Homework 1 (zw2975)
================

## Problem 1

``` r
# load the dataset from package
data("penguins", package = "palmerpenguins")
```

#### short descirption of the penguins dataset:

The `Penguins` dataset has variables `species`, `island`,
`bill_length_mm`, `bill_depth_mm`, `body_mass_g`, `sex`, and `year`.
This dataset has 344 rows and 8 columns. The mean flipper length of this
dataset is 200.9152047.

#### Scatter plot for bill length vs.Â flipper length

``` r
# saving the plot with a name
bill_flipper <- ggplot(penguins, aes(x = bill_length_mm , y = flipper_length_mm, color = species)) +
  geom_point() + 
  labs(title = "Bill length vs. flipper length for different species", 
       x = "Bill length in mm",
       y = "Flipper length in mm")

print(bill_flipper) #display the scatterplot
```

``` r

```

    ## Saving 7 x 5 in image

## Problem 2

``` r
dataframe <- tibble(
  x = rnorm(10), # it has a size 10 with standard normal distribution
  vec_logical = x > 10, # True if x>10, false if x is not >10
  vec_char = c("Hello", "my", "name", "is", "Zhiyu","Wei", "nice", "to", "meet", "you"), # 10 characters
  vec_factor = c("1", "2", "3","1", "2", "3", "1", "2", "3", "3" )) # 3 factor levels assigned to each character
```

``` r
# try to take mean for each variable
# mean of the numeric variable
mean(dataframe 
     %>% pull(x))
```

    ## [1] 0.01412318

``` r
# mean = 0.09992325

# mean of the logical variable
mean(dataframe 
     %>% pull(vec_logical))
```

    ## [1] 0

``` r
# mean = 0

# mean of the character variable
mean(dataframe 
     %>% pull(vec_char))
```

    ## [1] NA

``` r
# mean is NA

# mean of the factor variable
mean(dataframe 
     %>% pull(vec_factor))
```

    ## [1] NA

``` r
# mean is NA
```

``` r
# logical variable to numeric
as.numeric(dataframe$vec_logical)

# character variable to numeric
as.numeric(dataframe$vec_char)

# factor variable to numeric
as.numeric(dataframe$vec_factor)
```

#### What happened?

I got a warning saying that NAs are created due to coercion. The logical
variable all became 0. The character variable all became NA. The factor
variable has numeric values now but that is because the levels were
originally set to be numbers.
